# Applied-Cybersecurity-Incident-Response-Web-Attacks-and-Secure-System-Design
This repository showcases a hands-on cybersecurity project simulating a real-world security incident in a financial organization. It covers the full security lifecycle, including incident response, evidence collection, offensive testing, secure protocol design, &amp; access control evaluation, aligned with SOC operations &amp; enterprise defense practices.



#  Project Objectives

Investigate and document a simulated security incident in a financial environment
